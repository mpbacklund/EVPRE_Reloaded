#Future Additions
* Fastsim is good, but it would be even better if we could implement a machine learning model
* The current, "simple" model that this program uses doesn't take weather into account. As the model expands we would like to re-implement weather data (specifically temperature) into the model. We don't want this to add to the time the model takes to run by too much. First, we need to find a paper detailing the effects of temperature on ev vehicle efficiency. From there we should be able to add a scalar for temperature.
* Vehicle information should be moved to the database
